            <h2>About BINI</h2>
            <p>Believing the Filipino talents are world class and inspired by the success of Korean Idol industry, ABS-CBN Head of Entertainment Productions Direk Laurenti Dyogi in envisioned forming groups of individuals who can totally perform through singing and dancing.

            In 2019, ABS-CBN launch Star Hunt Academy, the training ground for young aspiring talents to hone their talents in singing and dancing and develop them holistically and nurture them physically, and mentally.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
            <p><h1>2018-2020: Formation through Star Hunt Academy</h1>
                As part of his belief that "Filipino talent has a place on the global stage", Laurenti Dyogi, ABS-CBN's Head of Entertainment Production, had the thought of forming a training camp where youth aspiring to become superstars "can develop or further hone their talents." In 2018, ABS-CBN launched Star Hunt Academy (SHA), which had 250 auditionees between the ages of 16 and 19 years old from all over the Philippines. From this pool of auditionees, with recommendations from talent scouts, the first set of female SHA trainees was selected, composed of 12 girls. While Dyogi initially planned to debut a nine-member idol girl group, it was eventually trimmed down to eight girls: <strong>Aiah Arceta, Colet Vergara, Maloi Ricalde, Gwen Apuli, Stacey Sevilleja, Mikha Lim, Jhoanna Robles,</strong> and <strong>Sheena Catacutan.</strong> Of the eight members, two <strong>Sheena and Gwen</strong> were originally housemates from Pinoy Big Brother: Otso.
                
                The group trained from  2019 to 2020 under local coaches, who include Kitchy Molina, the professional vocal coach and former chair of the Department of Voice, Music Theater, and Dance at the University of the Philippines College of Music; Austrian-born dance coach Mickey Perz; and South Korean coaches from MU Doctor Academy.
                
                On August 3, 2019 the group debuted as SHA trainees during the online pre-show of PBB Otso Big Night. They performed at their first mall show in Taguig on August 15, 2019. Later in 2019, they appeared at a National Youth Commission event where they were named youth ambassadors. They also participated in the 2019 Manila Southeast Asian Games thanksgiving celebration.

                On May 2020 Dyogi released a performance practice video of the group singing and dancing to "Ngiti" (Smile) by Young JV and Gary Valenciano on Twitter to show their progress in training. In August 2020 the group participated in the Philippine K-pop Convention's Happy Hallyu Day 4 event, performing K-pop dance covers, including Red Velvet's "In & Out", Blackpink's "How You Like That" and Twice's "More & More".

                <h1>2020: Pre-debut activities, "Da Coconut Nut"</h1>
                For Bini's pre-debut single, MU Doctor Academy and South Korean music production group Vo3e collaborated to transform national artist Ryan Cayabyab's novelty song <strong>"Da Coconut Nut"</strong> into an electropop remake. In addition, MU Doctor Academy collaborated with choreographers Moon Yeon-joo and Kwak Seong-chan, who formerly worked with K-pop groups, to create the choreography.
                
                On November 6, 2020 the official lyric video for their remake of <strong>"Da Coconut Nut"</strong>, premiered on the group's official YouTube channel.
